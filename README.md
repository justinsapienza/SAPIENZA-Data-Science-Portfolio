# Projects

## [Tidy Data](https://github.com/justinsapienza/SAPIENZA-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

The tidy data project focuses on organizing datasets to make them easier to analyze and interpret through visualizations. It emphasizes reshaping and transforming data so that each variable is in its own column, each observation forms its own row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table. This approach simplifies data cleaning to enhance analytical tools that allow for more efficient exploration and visualization of data.

The tidy data project complements my data science portfolio by showcasing my ability to clean, structure, and organize datasets effectively, a critical skill for any data-driven role. The project highlights my understanding of data tidying principles and ability to prepare data for insightful analysis and visualization. Additionally, it demonstrates my proficiency with tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, reinforcing my skills in translating messy datasets into meaningful insights.
