Basic Streamlit Project
=================
This project involves creating an interactive web application using Python and the Streamlit library.

Project Overview
----------------
The goal of the basic Streamlit project is to create a simple, interactive web application that transforms data analysis into an accessible and user-friendly experience. This involves showcasing key insights through visualizations, enabling user interaction to explore data, and turning static Python scripts into shareable applications. It’s designed to demonstrate the ability to communicate data-driven findings effectively while enhancing user engagement with interactive tools.

Dataset Description
-------------------
The dataset for this project is Palmer's Penguins.

The Palmer's Penguins dataset is a popular dataset used for teaching data exploration and visualization. It contains observations of 344 penguins from three species—Adélie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap—collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The dataset includes variables such as species, island, bill length and depth (in millimeters), flipper length (in millimeters), body mass (in grams), and sex.
